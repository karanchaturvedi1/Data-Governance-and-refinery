We have a couple credit cards that we are tired of and are ready to be out of debt for good. The banks are no help since they are the ones who want us in debt to begin with so we need your help!   Our financial situation:  We are hard working dedicated people with a sense of personal responsibility.  We both pay our debts in full and on time as you will notice in my credit rating. We have had two smaller Prosper loans that were ALWAYS paid on time and paid off. My husband is well employed and enjoys the work that he does tremendously. If you have interest in bidding you can be sure that we will make good on our debt to you. My hope is that we will be able to be in a lending situation in the next year so we can help others who have helped us. Below is an outline of our monthly budget for you to review:  My monthly budget:  Net income                      $4,400 (after deductions) Mortgage                         $1,750 Car payment 1                 $338 Insurance                         $58 Utilities                            $240 Credit Cards                     $400 Groceries                        $400 Gas                                  $50 (my gas is company paid, my wife hardly drives anywhere) --------------------------------------------------- Total bills                        $3236 Free cash flow after bills   $1164  You will see that we will have enough cash every month to easily pay back this loan, so please BID WITH CONFIDENCE!",debt_consolidation,Paying Off Credit Cards!!!!,786xx,TX,17.51,2,3,15,,11,0,22388,91.3,41,f,2910.66,0,0,0,0,,INDIVIDUAL,,135th week,0,,,

This loan will help me get back on track financially.  I would like to eliminate credit card debt and stop using credit cards altogether.  At this time I pay close to $1000 in credit card monthly payments.  I pride myself in being responsible and paying off my debts, but this high monthly payment makes it hard for me to save money.  I intend to pay more than the monthly amount but it would be easier if I could take advantage of paying a lower rate and paying the money owed sooner.  I would like to be able to save to have my own place one day.

I am a single, working mother with two boys. The oldest is 24 and recently got his MBA. My youngest is 16 and learning to drive.  I ended up accumulating most of my debt in the past couple years. The main reason is that my youngest son was in and out of the hospital. Hotel rooms, food etc added up as well as other bills.   I have a very secure union job with over 20 years at the same company.  I have not been one day late on any payment in over 6 years and have been paying way above the minimum balance on many bills. However, one lump sum loan would make juggling various bills much easier while also lowering my interest rates significantly.   I thank you for your time!

I have the contact information for the travel agency if you would like to contact them to verify the costs.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I have always dreamed of having an African wedding. Considering the costs associated with a US wedding, the amount I am asking for is fairly small and want to do the African wedding because it is a cheap but also unique way to have the wedding of my dreams.  I have full faith I will be able to pay off the cost of my wedding well before the 3 year period since my husband and I will be able to consolidate our expenses after our marriage.  thank you for your consideration in making my wedding dream come true!<br/>",wedding,African Safari Wedding,200xx,DC,8.49,1,1,8,,11,0,9044,24.1,32,f,1905.91,0,0,0,0,,INDIVIDUAL,,122th week,0,,,

I had been living for the past 2+ years with a roommate and I had paid the full security deposit of $3,000.  With the OK of my landlord, I vacated and my roommate decided to remain at the house on a month-to-month basis.  My name has been taken off of the lease.  The landlord has retained the security deposit since one roommate remained and advise me to settle the security deposit issue with the remaining roommate.  My former-roommate promised to fully reimburse me for the security deposit by mid-June but has failed to do so.  Now my former roommate has advised me that she will be giving notice to vacate by the end of July and will tell the landlord that the security deposit should be returned to me.   In the mean time, I have paid to get into my new place and had been expecting to have the use of my security deposit funds.  My loan request is to cover this money that I previously though I would have the use of but now will likely have to wait until mid-August to actually recieve.   I have been employed at my present job for the past 17-years and have a solid repayment record with my accounts.

I have an unsecured personal loan at a 17.99% interest rate over five years. I have been paying on it for about 1 year at $570/month without ever missing a payment. My current mortgage is $1470/mo, car is $670,phone is 30, internet is 35. I have no childcare expenses or credit card debt. I have a payment for replacement windows of 100/mo, and 85/mo on a student loan. We budget $125/week for groceries, 200/mo for gas. 50/mo for water, and 250/mo for electric. I bring home about 5400 per month and my husband makes 1600/month. I only want this loan because I think based on my credit history that my current interest rate is ridiculous. I have $5000 in savings and $18000 in available credit with my bank if something were to happen with my job. However, nursing is very secure and my hospital has not decreased wages, laid anyone off, frozen wages or stopped hiring.

Thank you for working with me to meet the rest of my financial needs with this loan.<br/>  > Here is some additional information concerning my start up business   and business plan.  As far is my business plan I've been working the last 7 months I have 3 years of cash flow projections laid out.  At a starting capacity of only 30 percent of the vendor booths filled, it should only take 6 months of being in Business, growing 5 percent per month in order to reach profitability.  I have a revenue streams set up to make money from renting vendor booths on a 3 month lease also an advertising ring of local businesses inside of the store a long with cleaning revenue of the booths per week ect.  The location is anchored by a major national retailer along with 10 other small stores and consists of 47,000 square feet of space.<br/>  > At our startup company we plan on keeping a positive footprint in the community.  We will be offering certain weekends where we will be donating a small portion of our revenues 2 werthy causes such as the humane society, different cancer research organizations, fire departments, etc.  Additionally we have a 5 year plan to hire a total of 13 full time employees and 4 part time employees.  Not only will we be creating jobs and helping worthy organization's, but we will be providing a place for individuals to both buy and sale items<br/>  > Just to give a small excerpt of my work history, I have a bachelor of science degree in business administration with a concentration of marketing from a major university.  Additionally I have 5 years of management experience 10 years of retail experience, and have been at my full time job for over 10 years now.  I have both of my vehicles paid off and i am paying on a mortgage for both my primary and a rental home that I own.  I am 1 of the senior members of my team at work and would make a very good borrower due to the fact that I must maintain a good credit history for the job I currently work and have I had only 1 late payment in the last 10 years<br/>  > I have worked with a small business development center to stream line my business plan in order to find any of the usual pitfalls for a startup business, ahead of time.<br/>  > Questions?<br/>null  > Second hand retail sales is a booming market right now!

The purpose of this loan is to provide the final tranche of funding for a long-planned, extensive interior renovation of my home. I purchased the home in October 2009, and got a great price because of the remodeling that was needed.   The person I bought the house with took off four months after we moved in, leaving me with the mortgage (I hold full title to the house), and in the financial scramble that followed, my credit rating took a hit, as I took out a bunch of credit cards and had to carry balances.  Since then, I have landed a job that pays more than both of our combined salaries when we bought the place. I am an in-house lobbyist for a clean energy company, in a senior position with a stable, annual salary.   I have a monthly disposable income of $4700--after mortgage payments. I have a tenant to help defray the mortgage, and this renovation will help make the house more comfortable for two people who do not share a bedroom. Right now the layout for the kitchen and common areas are cramped and poorly thought out--the house was originally flipped.  I've done as much work on the house as I can with my own hands--extensive landscaping and a new patio. Now it is time to work on the inside, and I am no plumber or carpenter or electrician. Because I haven't been in the house long, I'm not eligible for a home equity line of credit, but I do have a homeowner's loan and a personal loan from a credit union--however, banks are conservative these days and my credit score is still recovering from last year, so it is not quite enough.  I am turning to LendingClub to put me over the top for the renovation which this house needs, so it can be the place I envisioned when I bought it nearly two years ago. Home values are going up in my neighborhood, but I need this work to allow my home to express its true worth, and to be more livable for me and a tenant, as well to be more attractive any renters or sellers in the future should I ever move.   But I'm not planning to move for a while. I love my house. But the tiny kitchen and bathroom are starting to drive me bonkers. Thanks to all potential investors for helping me realize the wonderful home I have been waiting for.   I am happy to answer any questions, and thank you.  Update:   Thanks to everyone who has invested so far--this is an exciting process, and I hope we can get all the way to the goal in these last few days.

I'm very pleased to see an opportunity like this where people can help other people and make a safe investment as well. I'm so sick of the banks and financial industry having all the power. That's why """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Damn the Man"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""".  The short story is after dealing with a computer error on my Home Depot payment,  (Citi Bank) which they owned up to and admitted there were some glitches, my payment posted late by less than 24 hours. They so conveniently raised my rate to the default of 29.99%. When I inquired and tried to get my rate reset, they said they have no control or ability to do that.  I've never had such a bad experience with any other company or my other Citi accounts.  I only need 2666.00 to pay off the Depot account, it's already been closed, I'm done with them. The balance will be used to consolidate 1 other card that is at 17%, about another $1750.00.  The remaining be paid back to lending club early, at this point I have no need for it, my remaining credit accounts are all at reasonable rates. FYI, the credit score listed is incorrect, I have CreditSecure with American Express and my combined Fico score as December 1st was 703, down from 730 over the last year  because my balances on a couple cards increased for business use and has not been paid down yet. I am self employed, my company is 2.5 years old and solid. We due, however have a fairly high overhead presently and are trying to reduce our existing CC debt which we used for start up and operating capital for the first 6 months. I welcome questions.  Thanks in advance for your interest and investment should you choose to do so.  Sincerely, #450216.<br/> 553609 added on 12/10/09 > Loan re-listed, sorry for the inconvenience, I sent an email regarding """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""how"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to cancel loan, customer support took that as a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""request"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and removed my listing.

I have not missed a payment to any of my creditors on over 5 years. I am now seeing that my creditors are raising my APRs and it is harder to make the minimums. I am requesting this loan in order to eradicate my high rate credit card debts and be able to make one simple payment each month. I will then begin to slowly close the paid off accounts so that I will not be tempted to use uneeded credit. I subscribe to myfico.com and Susie Orman which has made me aware of so many blunders some of us experience. I now just need the extra funds to put this plan into action. I am a very responsible sales manager with over eight years at the same job. I have been at the same residence for over four years.<br/>  > Dear Investor/Lender,<br/>Thank you in advance for your consideration.<br/>I will be using this money to pay off credit card debt.<br/>I will begin to close out my credit card accounts slowly in order to lower the amount of my available credit to avoid future mistakes of overspending.<br/>I am a good borrower as I have not missed any payments on my accounts. I am taking this measure to insure that my credit rating stays positive while allowing me the breathing room to stay ahead of my debt. I am a college graduate and understand that once you receive credit, you are responsible for paying it back.<br/>My monthly income is around $8,000.00 before tax.<br/>I rent and pay $600.00 a month.<br/>I have been at the same job for over 8 years and I am an employee in great standing.

During my schooling, bills have gradually increased, but now I will be able to take care of them faster now that I can work full time and look for a better paying job that is applicable to my field of study. My father has owned his business for over 27 years repairing street cars. He has turned it into a multi million dollar business that will always secure a job for me if the work market fails. He allows me to get all the over time that I'm willing to sacrifice my time for, in which case I usually put in over 50 hours a week. In which case, my checks average 380 a week. Also, for every ASE certification I pass, which I plan on passing more, I get a 75 cent raise. So I plan on passing at least 3 more before finding a better paying job in my field, which will make my weekly payment that much more significant.  My rent is only 325.00 a month, utilities are split with two other roomates(averaging about $75 per month, per person). My car insurance, health insurance, and cell phone bills are covered by my parents so I do not carry that financial burden. So two weeks out of the month take care of my living expenses, while the other two weeks can be used to pay off any debt I have. But I am a young, healthy, and physically active man who is motivated to get on top of my debt and savings so I can start a successful life and buy a house within five years.<br/>",debt_consolidation,Consolidating,402xx,KY,13.2,0,6,,,5,0,4561,76,6,f,26.45,0,88.1,0.82,0,,INDIVIDUAL,,4th week,0,,,

This is my first home and have been doing many home improvements myself, such as tiling, painting, carpeting, a new walkway.  A few weeks ago, we had a pretty bad rainstorm, and my basement flooded.  I now have to waterproof my basement, but have ran out of money.  I need to demo and gut my basement walls, which I'm doing myself to save money, but I am hiring a waterproofing company to install the interior drains and sump pump, and it is going to cost a pretty penny.  I have been active duty Air Force in the Security Forces unit for almost 7 years.  My car will be paid off in July, which means I'll no longer have a car payment.    I have good credit (around 700), have no debt except for my mortgage, and do not believe in credit cards.<br/>",home_improvement,Home Improvement,152xx,PA,15.32,1,0,22,,3,0,0,0,8,f,1857.57,0,0,0,0,,INDIVIDUAL,,131th week,0,,,

Your consideration of my loan is much appreciated.<br/>  > My monthly gross income is approx. $3400 a month.  I have a car payment of $379/month, loan payment of $369/month at 18% from big box bank that I have been paying for two years and two credit cards with a combined minimum monthly payment of approx. $100/month.  I live rent free through an arrangement made long ago with a family friend and my only other expenses are the usual utilities, cable, cell phone, gas.  I am never late on my payments.  This loan would enable me to pay off my loan and credit cards, reduce my monthly payments, and eliminate my debt sooner.  I can assure you that funding my loan is of no risk to you and hopefully will be mutually beneficial.  I will happily answer any questions you may have.

The other is investing in the currently-booming stock market.  I'm relatively conservative as an investor, I set stop-losses on everything, and even my more aggressive investments are pretty conservative.  In any case, I only get aggressive with a small percentage of my investment capital.  I do a lot of research, I talk to people, I have made good choices, and I have made a 30% total return on my investments over the past two months alone.  I don't like losing money, and I'm not greedy...I'm perfectly happy with the rate of return I have been getting so far, and I'm doing a lot of research to maintain it and improve on it.  I am a Princeton graduate--which I only mention to assure you that I have a good brain, and a number of former classmates to advise me well on how to continue to make good returns even when the market slumps and makes its periodic corrections.  My main frustration right now is this: as a teacher I have only a small-sized pool of capital to work with, and there are so many opportunities out there right now that I would like a larger amount of capital available to me, to take advantage of more of these opportunities.

This loan will be repaid through the income brought in through my advertisers and the new clients I bring in through my advertising. My advertising thus far has been very effective at bringing in new business; I just have not had the finances to advertise to the extent I want or that my business needs.  I also wish to consolidate/pay off the $5,000 in debt I currently hold. $4,000 has been debt from my business expenses and $1,000 is because I gave that card to my mom when she was going through a rough time with medical problems and her job last year.

I am very responsible, pay all my bills on time and have very little debt other than my house and about $1,500 in credit cards which I am currently paying on monthly and a car loan which is close to being paid off. I have money in savings, a Roth Ira and a 401k. I am a very careful spender and just need a small loan to complete some household projects. We are expecting a baby in the spring and are in the process of renovating an extra room to make another bedroom. We are also trying to update our kitchen to make more space in the cabinets. If we have any spare money left over, we would love to purchase an older pickup truck to make working around the house  easier.

I have spent the last 24 months paying down my mortgage and eliminating debt.  This loan will help me reduce interest further and pay it off faster.  I have a senior in high school and I am also investing in his education without burdening him with student loans.  I have lived in my home over 6 years, and have worked in the same industry over 15.  Freedom from debt is my goal this year and I am thrilled with Lending Club.  When I pay this debt, I am going to grow my reserve accounts by investing in other members.

Created in 2008, TutoringOne is an exciting and innovative method of providing academic tutoring in the home of every student.  Utilizing the power and reach of the Internet, TutoringOne strategically provides a comprehensive program, which successfully supports the academic future of all students.

Teachers are specifically qualified to teach high school core academic subject areas, especially in the areas of mathematics and science. In addition, services are available for students with disabilities and second language learners.  Revenue will be generated by state funding (SES & Title 1 School Choice Programs), Individual School sites and School District contracts (5 contracts have already been negotiated) and online advertising from .EDU based learning programs (i.e SAT prep courses, Sylvan Learning Centers, University of Phoenix, etc etc).  We need $15,000 to develop and deploy the website code and the other $15,000 will be used for other start up expenses (i.e Servers, Marketing Materials, Salaries, Legal fees, etc). This loan will be paid back with in 3 years, if not sooner.  When looking at my revolving credit it may seem to be high, but $9,000 is a motorcycle payment on a Suzuki Credit Card and the motorcycle is currently being sold.  If you have any questions or comments please feel free to ask and I will respond as soon as possible.

In those two years, I had a few jobs which didn't pay particularly well and a few months of unemployment.  I relied too heavily on credit cards to fill the gaps when my job wasn't enough.  Before I knew it, I was buried in credit card debt and the rates on the majority of the debt had more than doubled.  I have since found a secure job in my field of study (which I have been at for almost two years now) and have learned to budget and stop using/relying on credit cards.  However, my debt haunts me and I would like to consolidate my three accounts into one fixed (and lower) APR so I can pay them off as soon as possible and be finished with them.    The amount requested will cover all three cards and will fit nicely into my budget.  Also, having a fixed-term loan, as opposed to the open-ended credit cards, would be a great personal relief that gives me a set date that the total debt will be repaid.  I'm still young but I'm starting to think of my financial future and I'm confident this is the first step.
